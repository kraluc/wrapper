# wrapper

First we look at a simply Jupyter Notebook way of building the blocks of code

+ refer to the jupyter notebook [wrapper.ipynb](./wrapper.ipynb) to start the exercise
+ associated [wrapper_solution.ipynb](./wrapper_solution.ipynb) notebook includes the solution

Then we migrate those blocks into a Python script and augment it with logging argparse

+ [wrapper.py](./wrapper.py) includes the original module structure with logging and argparse
+ [wrapper_solution.py](./wrapper_solution.py) will be updated with the solution.
